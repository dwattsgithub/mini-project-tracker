# Project Tracker

## Description
Project Tracker is a web application that allows users to keep track of their projects. It provides a user-friendly interface to add project details, including the project name, type, and due date. The application also displays the current date and time in real-time, making it convenient for users to track their project deadlines.

### Motivation
The motivation behind creating this project was to build a practical project management tool that helps individuals or teams organize their tasks and projects efficiently. It serves as a simple yet effective way to manage project details and stay aware of upcoming deadlines.

### Problem Solving
Project Tracker solves the problem of disorganized project management by providing an easy-to-use interface for adding, viewing, and deleting projects. It helps users keep track of project details and ensures that they are aware of upcoming project due dates.

### Learning
While developing Project Tracker, we learned how to use Bootstrap for responsive web design, integrate Day.js for real-time date and time updates, and utilize jQuery for DOM manipulation and event handling. This project also improved our skills in working with local storage to store and retrieve project data.
